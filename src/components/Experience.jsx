      "In order to capitalize on the closed circuit situation, where people are urged to stay at home and outdoor movement is constrained, Plateable, a food delivery startup, was founded during the pandemic. The app's ability to accept orders from numerous restaurants and regardless of distance on the island is one of its distinctive selling points. For delivery services, the app communicates with lalamove; integration is accomplished via API. I was the primary developer for the react native based mobile vendor app. The app must adhere to the UIUX design guidelines and use graphql to integrate with the backend. Additionally, it was finished in less than three months. \n More info about the app here: https://appadvice.com/app/plateable-vendor-app/1526287725",

The apps include a geofence app to guarantee student safety inside the school and a parents' community app. Each student is given a bluetooth beacon card, which often transmits a signal. As a result, bluetooth receivers are installed in strategic locations across campus to track student mobility. These information are processed and store in firebase, therefore the app communicate with it and present the data in a insightful manner.\n More info about the app here:\n https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geofence-smart-cookies/id1479109613?platform=iphone\n https://appadvice.com/app/geofence-smart-cookies/1479109613\n \n The parents community app is for the parents of the school's students, as its name suggests.
